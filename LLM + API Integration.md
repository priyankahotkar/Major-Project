**Document: AI-Driven Mentorship and Personalized Roadmap Platform**

---

###  **Concept Overview**

**AI-Powered Personalized Learning Roadmap Generator**

The platform uses a combination of user-provided data (via GitHub, LeetCode, Codeforces, Notion-like logs) and LLMs (such as OpenAI's GPT or Google's Gemini) to analyze learning behavior, code activity, and project involvement. Based on this, it dynamically generates customized roadmaps across domains such as DSA, full stack, mobile app development, ML, and more.

#### **Core Workflow:**

1. **User Activity Integration**: Pulls data via GitHub, LeetCode, and other APIs to assess coding frequency, topics, strengths, and weaknesses.

2. **Journal Integration**: Embedded Notion-like journaling for user reflection, learning logs, and AI tracking.

3. **AI Analysis**: LLM evaluates the data and journaling to suggest optimal next learning paths.

4. **Dynamic Roadmap Rendering**: A visual adaptive roadmap is shown and updated as users learn.

5. **Progress Tracker \+ Gamification**: Milestones, badges, and weekly reports based on activity and roadmap progression.

Use Cases:

* Personalized upskilling for students

* Adaptive mentoring for professionals

* Productivity aid for learning teams/startups

  ### **Project Technical Overview**

**1\. Is This Easy to Build?**

Building a personalized AI-based learning roadmap system integrated with productivity tools and user data is achievable, but it requires careful architecture and planning. Here is a breakdown of the major components:

| Module | Description | Difficulty (1-5) | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| API Integrations | Connect GitHub, LeetCode, Codeforces, etc. | 🔘🔘🔘 | GitHub APIs are great; others may need workarounds. |
| OAuth \+ Token Management | Secure user authentication and data access | 🔘🔘🔘🔘 | Complex flows and refresh handling needed. |
| Notion-like Journal | Use Tiptap/Slate \+ Firebase/MongoDB | 🔘🔘 | Available editors simplify this. |
| LLM Integration | Use GPT/Gemini to process and recommend actions | 🔘🔘🔘 | Prompt engineering is crucial. |
| Smart Dashboard | Charts, analytics, feedback | 🔘🔘🔘🔘 | Requires custom visual state logic. |
| Roadmap Adaptation | Change roadmap based on AI output | 🔘🔘🔘🔘 | Heavy on conditional UI updates. |

###  **Project Execution Strategy**

* **Phase 1: MVP**

  * GitHub \+ LeetCode stats

  * GPT-based analysis

  * Static roadmap rendering

* **Phase 2: Productivity Layer**

  * Notion-like journal

  * More API integrations

  * Analytics dashboard

* **Phase 3: AI Coach**

  * Fully dynamic learning path

  * GPT interaction

  * Weekly guidance reminders

This architecture allows modular scaling from v1 to a powerful intelligent coaching system.

### **⚖️ API Limitations & Rate Policies**

| Platform | Rate Limit | Auth Required? | Free? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GitHub | 60/hr (unauth) ❘ 5,000+/hr (auth) |  for 5k/hr | ✅ Free |
| LeetCode | \~20 req / 10s via wrappers | Needed for user-specific | ✅ Free |
| Codeforces | 1 req per 2s | No | ✅ Free |
| HackerRank | N/A (no official API) | N/A | ⚠️ Risky |

**Notes:**

* Authenticate wherever possible (GitHub requires tokens for user-level data).

* LeetCode and HackerRank do not provide stable official APIs. Use community tools with caution.

* Throttle and cache responses to stay within limits.

  ### **🔗 Accessing GitHub API**

**REST API v3**

* Docs: [https://docs.github.com/en/rest](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

* Base URL: `https://api.github.com`

* Example: `GET /users/{username}/repos`

**GraphQL API v4**

* Docs: [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)

* Endpoint: `https://api.github.com/graphql`

**Authentication (PAT)**

* Create at: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

* Use scopes: `repo`, `read:user`, `user:email`

* Example:

  curl \-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user/repos

  ### **🔹 Summary**

You’re building a system that:

* Analyzes coding activity across platforms

* Generates adaptive learning paths using LLMs

* Embeds a notion-like reflection tool

* Tracks productivity

* Is technically feasible and has startup-level potential

**Next Steps?**

* Implement GitHub API first (stable and rich data)

* Use GPT to test prompts for roadmap logic

* Add a journaling UI with Tiptap

* Design adaptive roadmap front-end

This is **future-forward** and perfectly aligned with the developer productivity niche.
