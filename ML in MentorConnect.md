## **ðŸ”¥ Project ML Integration Concept**

### **ðŸŽ¯ AI-Powered Personalized Learning Roadmap Generator**

---

### **ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement**

Most learners blindly follow generic roadmaps that ignore their actual pace, strengths, weaknesses, or time availability. This leads to burnout, dropout, and poor skill alignment.

---

### **âœ… Your Solution**

Build an ML-based engine that generates **customized learning paths** tailored to the userâ€™s:

* Current skill level (via short quiz or input)

* Learning goal (e.g. "Crack FAANG", "Get an internship", "Build an app")

* Time commitment (hours/day)

* Learning style preference (videos, docs, practice-first)

* Past performance (if they've synced LeetCode or GitHub)

  ---

  ### **ðŸ§  ML Strategy (Lightweight & Realistic for B.Tech Project)**

  #### **Option 1: Rule-Based \+ GPT Hybrid (Easy to Implement)**

* Collect user inputs via form or chatbot

* Classify them using decision trees or rule mapping

* Use GPT-4 API to generate a path with prompt templates like:  
   *"Generate a 3-month MERN roadmap for a college student who prefers video-based learning and has 2 hours daily."*

* Display the plan with progress tracking.

  ---

  #### **Option 2: ML Classifier (If You Want Real ML)**

* Train a classifier on existing curated roadmap data (DSA, Web, ML)

* Input vector: user type, experience, hours/day, goals

* Output class: roadmap cluster (beginner-fast, intermediate-deep, etc.)

* Use clustering to group users and tailor suggestions

  ---

  ### **ðŸ§° Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: React (form \+ display)

* **ML Backend**: Python (Flask or FastAPI)

* **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 / fine-tuned model

* **Database**: Firebase or MongoDB to track user inputs and progress

  ---

  ### **ðŸ“Š Additional Edge**

* Integrate practice platforms (like LeetCode API, GitHub profile, Codeforces ratings)

* Adapt the roadmap dynamically every week â€” *just like Spotify Wrapped for devs*

  ### **ðŸ›  Sample Prompt (If GPT is used)**

  css

  CopyEdit

  `Act like a career mentor.`

  `The user is a 3rd-year CS student who wants to crack product-based companies in 6 months.`

  `She has 3 hours/day, prefers video + practice-based learning.`

  `Give a weekly plan for mastering DSA and system design.`


  ---

  ### **ðŸš€ Why This Wins**

* It's innovative but feasible

* Uses real ML/AI (guides will love it)

* Solves a *real* problem students face

* Gives *mentorconnect* a massive head start on becoming a true ed-tech product
