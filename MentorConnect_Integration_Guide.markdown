**Use in MentorConnect**:
The OpenAI Agents SDK for TypeScript provides a lightweight framework to build AI agents for MentorConnect, enabling intelligent, context-aware interactions between mentors and mentees. Key applications include:

- **AI-Powered Mentorship Assistant**: Create an AI agent to assist users by answering common mentorship queries (e.g., "How do I prepare for a mentorship session?") or suggesting relevant mentors based on user profiles. The agent can use the SDK's `Agent` and `run` primitives to process user inputs and generate responses.
  ```typescript
  import { Agent, run } from '@openai/agents';

  const mentorAssistant = new Agent({
    name: 'MentorConnectAssistant',
    instructions: 'You are a mentorship assistant. Provide guidance on mentorship topics and suggest mentors based on user skills.',
  });

  async function handleUserQuery(query: string) {
    const result = await run(mentorAssistant, query);
    return result.finalOutput;
  }

  // Example usage
  handleUserQuery('Suggest a mentor for learning TypeScript').then(console.log);
  ```
- **Handoffs for Specialized Tasks**: Use the SDK's handoff feature to delegate tasks to specialized agents. For instance, one agent handles general queries, while another matches mentees with mentors based on skills or goals stored in Firestore.
- **Guardrails for Safety**: Implement input validation to ensure user queries are appropriate (e.g., filtering out irrelevant or harmful requests) using the SDK's guardrail feature, enhancing platform safety.
- **Tracing for Debugging**: Utilize built-in tracing to monitor and debug agent interactions, ensuring reliable performance for user-facing features.

**Setup**:
1. Install the SDK: `npm install @openai/agents`
2. Set the OpenAI API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
