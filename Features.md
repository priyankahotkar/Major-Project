🚀 Mentor Connect – Feature Specification Document
This document lists all the proposed features for the Mentor Connect platform. Each feature is described with its purpose, importance, and planned implementation.

1. 🎯 Use ML Model in Chat
Purpose: To make chat intelligent by auto-suggesting responses or detecting doubt category.
Why: Helps reduce mentor effort and gives instant answers to common questions.
How:Integrate a pre-trained ML/NLP model (e.g. DistilBERT or spaCy).Model classifies messages into categories (e.g. frontend, backend, placement).Based on classification, auto-suggest responses or redirect to FAQs.

2. 🤖 Recommendation System
Purpose: To recommend mentors, resources, or sessions to students.
Why: Saves student time in finding the right mentor or material.
How:Use a collaborative or content-based filtering approach.Based on student branch, year, past interactions, or ratings.Display top 3–5 mentor matches or sessions in student dashboard.

3. 🎙️ Voice Chat
Purpose: Add real-time voice communication between mentor and student.
Why: Helpful for doubt explanation where typing is not efficient.
How:Use WebRTC with libraries like simple-peer or peerjs.Connect users over secure peer-to-peer voice call.Include "Start Call" and "End Call" buttons in meeting room.

4. 🗺️ ML Model for Personalized Roadmaps
Purpose: Generate learning roadmaps for students based on goals.
Why: Gives students a structured learning plan.
How:Input: Student selects goal (e.g. Web Dev, AI, Placement Prep).ML model predicts learning path based on similar students.Output roadmap with topics, mentors, and resources in order.

5. 🏅 Badges for Students
Purpose: Gamify learning and boost engagement.
Why: Recognizes consistent student participation.
How:Track number of sessions and mentors connected.If student connects with ≥ 10 mentors or attends ≥ 20 sessions:Award badge like “Active Learner”, “Connector”.Show badge on student profile.

6. 🏆 Top Mentor Awards
Purpose: Highlight and reward helpful mentors.
Why: Motivates mentors to contribute regularly.
How:Track number of sessions, feedback ratings, and student reviews.Show "Top Mentor" badge if a mentor is in top 3 weekly/monthly.Display leaderboard on mentor dashboard.
